# AI Recruiting Agent

## Project Overview

This project implements a candidate ranking system that matches job descriptions (JDs) with a dataset of candidate profiles. It uses a combination of fuzzy logic, structured parsing, and semantic search to rank candidates based on how well they align with the role requirements.

The pipeline evaluates each candidate across four dimensions:
- Job title similarity
- Skill match (with priority weighting)
- Qualification match (normalized degree + field matching + priority weighting)
- Semantic profile match (via embeddings)

The system outputs top candidates with a full breakdown of matched attributes and normalized scores.

## Candidate Scoring System

This system evaluates and ranks candidates against a given job description (JD) using a multi-step scoring pipeline. It combines fuzzy logic, structured extraction, and semantic search to generate a final score for each candidate.



### Scoring Components

Each candidate is scored based on the following criteria:

- **Job Title Match**  
  Compares the candidate’s current job title with the role specified in the JD using fuzzy string matching.

- **Skill Match**  
  Each skill in the JD is tagged with a priority level. Candidate skills are compared using fuzzy matching, and matches above a set threshold contribute to the skill score based on their importance.

- **Qualification Match**  
  JD-specified degrees and fields of study are normalized and matched against the candidate’s educational background. A valid match requires:
  - A normalized degree type match in the degree hierarchy
  - A field of study match above a defined fuzzy threshold

- **Semantic Profile Match**  
  The candidate’s entire profile is embedded using a sentence transformer and compared to the JD embedding using cosine similarity. This captures alignment in responsibilities, objectives, and experience.


### Skill Matching Logic

- Skills from the JD are structured with priority tags like `essential`, `important`, etc.
- Each candidate skill is compared using fuzzy logic (e.g., token set ratio)
- Matches above a threshold are collected and scored based on their priority

### Qualification Matching Logic

- Degree names are normalized using a fuzzy matcher and mapped to standard categories (e.g., bachelor, master)
- Fields of study are compared using fuzzy similarity
- Matches are scored based on their presence and relevance in the candidate’s qualifications and degree hierarchy

### Semantic Matching

Some attributes like **career objectives** and **responsibilities** are unstructured and cannot be matched using simple fuzzy logic.

To evaluate these:

- The candidate's profile (including responsibilities and objectives) and the job description are embedded using a sentence transformer.
- Cosine similarity is calculated between these embeddings to measure semantic alignment.
- This score reflects how well the candidate's goals and experience match the intent of the role.


### Final Score

Each candidate receives a normalized score for each component. These are combined into a final score that determines their overall suitability for the JD.

The final output includes:
- The candidate’s total score
- Individual component scores (title, skill, qualification, semantic)
- Matched skills and qualifications for transparency

## Quick Start

There are two ways to run the pipeline:

### 1. Run via Notebook (Google Colab)
You can explore and visualize the entire scoring process interactively in a Jupyter notebook.

> **[Run on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_KHLnPAZELhffVCuGwZBK6ZP9njoaAPg?usp=sharing)**

No setup is required — the notebook handles loading, filtering, scoring, and explanation.

---

### 2. Run via Python CLI (`main.py`)

If you prefer running the pipeline end-to-end via terminal:

```bash
uv venv  # Create virtual environment using uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

uv run main.py
```

Outputs the top-ranked candidates along with their scores and matched attributes.

---

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended for managing virtual environments and dependencies)

### Using `uv` (recommended)

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Without `uv`

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔑 Google Gemini API Key

This project uses the **Gemini API** from Google AI Studio for tasks like semantic JD generation and evaluation.

#### 1. Get Your API Key
- Sign in at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- Generate an API key (free tier available)

#### 2. Add the Key to Your Environment

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, open `.env` and add your key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

The project automatically loads this using `python-dotenv`.

#### 3. For Colab Users

In the Colab notebook, your key will be requested securely:

```python
from getpass import getpass
import os

os.environ['GEMINI_API_KEY'] = getpass('Enter your Gemini API key:')
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Evaluation and Validation

To validate the pipeline, multiple strategies were implemented:

* **Reverse Matching with Synthetic JDs:** 
To validate the pipeline, I generated synthetic job descriptions using an LLM based on individual candidate profiles. The evaluation checks whether the candidate whose profile was used to create the JD ranks among the top 3 results. This reverse matching approach helps verify that the scoring and matching logic correctly identifies highly relevant candidates when the JD is tailored to them.

* **Threshold Tuning:**
  Various score thresholds were tested to balance strictness and candidate retention.

* **Explainability Checks:**
  The top candidates include matched skills and qualifications for transparency and debugging.

## Scalability & Improvement Plans

To support larger candidate datasets and improve matching accuracy, the following enhancements are planned:

### 1. Use a Vector Database for Embedding Search
- **Current Limitation:** All semantic similarity scores are calculated in-memory, which is inefficient for large datasets.
- **Improvement:** Store and index candidate profile embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate, Qdrant, Pinecone) using an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm like HNSW for fast similarity search.
- **Benefit:** Scales semantic matching to hundreds of thousands of profiles with sub-second retrieval.

### 2. Fine-tune the Embedding Model
- **Current Limitation:** Generic sentence transformers may not capture nuances of hiring-specific language (e.g., skills vs responsibilities).
- **Improvement:** Fine-tune the model on a domain-specific corpus of resumes and job descriptions to improve semantic alignment.
- **Benefit:** More accurate ranking based on real-world hiring signals.

### 3. Improve Fuzzy Matching Logic
- **Standardize Inputs:**
  - Normalize case, punctuation, plurals, and abbreviations.
  - Map known synonyms or aliases (e.g., "JS" → "JavaScript").
- **Leverage Token-Based Similarity:** Use token set/sort ratios (already in use via RapidFuzz) but consider hybrid approaches:
  - **TF-IDF or BM25** for partial text blocks like responsibilities.
  - **Levenshtein Distance or Jaccard Similarity** for structured comparisons (e.g., sets of skills).
- **Skill Ontology or Taxonomy:** Introduce a lightweight skill taxonomy or embeddings to cluster similar skills (e.g., NumPy and pandas → Data Analysis).

### 4. Caching and Preprocessing
- **Improvement:** Cache preprocessed results (e.g., normalized degrees, embeddings) to reduce repeat computation during batch runs. I'm already storing the candidate profile embedding in the dataframe.
- **Benefit:** Improves efficiency for both offline batch scoring and interactive filtering.

### 5. Parallel Processing
- **Improvement:** Use Python multiprocessing or vectorized NumPy operations for fuzzy and semantic scoring over large datasets.
- **Benefit:** Speeds up evaluation significantly when scaling to tens of thousands of candidates.

### 6. Batch Evaluation and Logging
- Add support for:
  - Evaluating against multiple JDs in one run.
  - Logging top-N candidates with reasons (matched attributes, scores).
  - Exporting evaluation results in a structured format (JSON/CSV).
